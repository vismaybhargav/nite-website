# Summer Intensive Recap

Our summer intensive brought together students from 14 schools. Each week combined morning skill labs with afternoon build time. Evenings were saved for community dinners where teams shared works in progress.

## The Format

Week one focused on design research, week two on prototyping, week three on user testing, and week four on storytelling. Mentors rotated across teams to ensure every student felt supported.

## Highlights

- A team of ninth graders built a hardware button that translates classroom instructions into multiple languages.
- Seniors designed an audio tour that turns a local park into an outdoor history museum.
- The "Young Strategists" crew mapped how city agencies respond to resident feedback and prototyped a better workflow.

## What's Next

The intensive wrapped with a public demo night. We are working with city partners to pilot three of the projects this fall.
