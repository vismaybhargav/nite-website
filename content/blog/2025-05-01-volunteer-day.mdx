# Designing Our First Volunteer Build Day

We hosted our first volunteer build day this May, welcoming 40 industry mentors, alumni, and community members. The goal was ambitious: ship updates to both our learning management portal and studio hardware kits before the summer session.

## Planning for Flow

Volunteers were split into product squads with clear objectives. The schedule alternated between build blocks and short alignment huddles to keep momentum high.

## Impact in Hours

- The portal now includes a resource library that teachers can customize.
- Hardware kits ship with a new quick-start guide designed by students.
- Our support team logged double the usual number of resolved tickets.

## Lessons Learned

Next time we will add "office hours" so student teams can grab floating experts. Until then, we are documenting the playbook so other organizations can remix the approach.
