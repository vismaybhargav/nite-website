# Community Spotlight: Eastside Code Collective

Every Wednesday evening, NITE mentors pack laptops and lesson plans for the Eastside Code Collective. The community center in Ward 8 becomes a buzzing studio where middle schoolers remix games and remix their future.

## Shared Leadership

The partnership works because residents set the agenda. Parents suggested a rotating "design studio" that pairs high school mentors with middle school project teams. The result: younger students lead with their imagination while older peers guide feasibility.

## Outcomes in Motion

- Attendance tripled after introducing community-designed challenges.
- Families have started bringing their own tech questions, turning the studio into a mini help desk.
- The neighborhood association voted to fund weekend open lab hours.

## Why It Matters

The Eastside Code Collective is proof that tech education sticks when it is rooted in relationships. We are exploring how to replicate the model in two additional neighborhoods this year.
