# Inside the New NITE AI Labs

Our fall cohort walked into a brand-new space this semester: the NITE AI Labs. The lab features accessible workstations, tactile learning walls, and a "build bar" where students can prototype ideas in minutes.

## Why We Built It

The AI Labs grew out of a challenge: students needed a place where exploration, mentorship, and rapid iteration could coexist. With support from partners across the city we transformed a dormant media room into an innovation hub.

## What Students Are Learning

- Responsible AI fundamentals grounded in real-world case studies.
- Creative coding sessions that emphasize storytelling as much as syntax.
- Collaborative sprints that culminate in community demos and feedback sessions.

## Early Wins

Within four weeks, teams delivered accessible transit apps, machine learning models that map fresh food access, and immersive AR experiences for elementary classrooms.

## Looking Ahead

We are already planning weekend buildathons and parent community nights. If you would like to volunteer or host a workshop, reach out — the lab thrives when the community is in the room.
