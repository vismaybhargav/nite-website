import Image from "next/image"

This is a sample blog file in MDX. It's a type of markdown file that you can add react components to.
Make sure to include all the information above and optionally a category and read time.
The date HAS to be in that exact format so that it gets parsed correctly.

You can include divs like these but for now, only include basic html components and don't do any special styling in here.
<div>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
</div>

** If you want images, do this, its a NextJS component and needs to be imported at the top as I have. (After the metadata)
Make sure to send me the image in full quality if you do use an image. **
\
\
<Image src="image" alt="alternative text" width={400} height={500} />


When sending me the blog, send me this file and the images in a zip folder. The file path of your
image component should be / and then the filename so e.g /image.png
